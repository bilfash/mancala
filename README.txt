I created the game Mancala. There was no short comings and there are no known bugs.
The game depends on the folder images for run time.


Mancala Rules:

OBJECT: Collect the most stones in your mancala (mancalas are the large bowls at each end of the board).
 
	Each player "owns" a mancala on his side and the six small bowls. 
Player 1 starts by scooping up all the stones from one of his small bowls (players may never start 
from a mancala or from the opponent's six bowls). Player 1 drops one stone into the next bowl on the right,
one stone into the second bowl on the right, continuing around the board (counterclockwise) until he has no
more stones in his hand. If Player 1 reaches his own mancala, he drops a stone into it. Players do not drop
stones into their opponents' mancalas, they skip them and continue dropping stones, one at a time, from 
their hand until they run out of stones. Players take turns moving. At the end of the game, players count 
the stones in their mancalas - the player with the most stones wins.
	If a player drops the last stone from his hand into his mancala, he gets to move again. If a player drops the last
stone into one of the empty bowls on his side of the board, he takes that stone, plus all the stones in the 
opponent's bowl directly across from his bowl and places them in his mancala. The game ends when one player no longer has 
stones in his small bowls. The other player (who still has stones on his side) places all remaining stones into his own mancala
	My mancala game lets select the hole with stones you wish to move and the move is automated according to these 
rules above. The bottom row is player 1's row and the top row is player 2's row. The left bowl is is player 2's bowl and the 
right bowl is player 1's bowl. To view the conrols or see which which pot is yours press 'h' during the 
game to bring up or put away the help board that shows you the controls and what bowl is yours.
